# Backup to URL

**Estimated Time: 30 minutes**

As a DBA for AdventureWorks, you need to back up a database to a URL in Azure and restore it from Azure blob storage after a human error has occurred.

## Restore a database

1. Download the database backup file located on **https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/dp-300-database-administrator/blob/master/Instructions/Templates/AdventureWorks2017.bak** to **C:\LabFiles\HADR** path on the lab virtual machine (create the folder structure if it does not exist).

    ![Picture 03](../images/dp-300-module-07-lab-03.png)

1. Select the Windows Start button and type SSMS. Select **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18** from the list.  

    ![Picture 01](../images/dp-300-module-01-lab-34.png)

1. When SSMS opens, notice that the **Connect to Server** dialog will be pre-populated with the default instance name. Select **Connect**.

    ![Picture 02](../images/dp-300-module-07-lab-01.png)

1. Select the **Databases** folder, and then **New Query**.

    ![Picture 03](../images/dp-300-module-07-lab-04.png)

1. In the new query window, copy and paste the below T-SQL into it. Execute the query to restore the database.

    ```sql
    RESTORE DATABASE AdventureWorks2017
    FROM DISK = 'C:\LabFiles\HADR\AdventureWorks2017.bak'
    WITH RECOVERY,
          MOVE 'AdventureWorks2017' 
            TO 'C:\LabFiles\HADR\AdventureWorks2017.mdf',
          MOVE 'AdventureWorks2017_log'
            TO 'C:\LabFiles\HADR\AdventureWorks2017_log.ldf';
    ```

    **Note:** The database backup file name and path should match with what you've downloaded on step 1, otherwise the command will fail.

1. You should see a successful message after the restore is complete.

## Configure Backup to URL

1. From the lab virtual machine, start a browser session and navigate to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/). Connect to the Portal using the Azure **Username** and **Password** provided on the **Resources** tab for this lab virtual machine.

    ![Screenshot of Azure portal sign in page](../images/dp-300-module-01-lab-01.png)

1. Open a **Cloud Shell** prompt by selecting the icon shown below.

    ![Screenshot of cloud shell icon on Azure portal.](../images/dp-300-module-15-lab-01.png)

1. At the bottom half of the portal, you may see a message welcoming you to the Azure Cloud Shell, if you have not yet used a Cloud Shell. Select **Bash**.

    ![Screenshot of welcome page for cloud shell on Azure portal.](../images/dp-300-module-15-lab-02.png)

1. If you have not previously used a Cloud Shell, you must configure a storage. Select **Show advanced settings**.

    ![Screenshot of create storage for cloud shell on Azure portal.](../images/dp-300-module-15-lab-03.png)

1. Use the existing **Resource group** and specify new names for **Storage account** and **File share**, as shown in the dialog below. Make a note of the **Resource group** name. It should start with **DP-300-HADR**. Then select **Create storage**.

    ![Screenshot of the create storage account and file share on Azure portal.](../images/dp-300-module-15-lab-04.png)

1. Verify that the upper left corner of the Cloud Shell screen shows **Bash**.

    Once complete, you will see a prompt similar to the one below.

    ![Screenshot of the Cloud Shell prompt on Azure portal.](../images/dp-300-module-15-lab-05.png)

1. Create a new storage account from the CLI using by executing the following command in Cloud Shell. Your storage account name must be unique and all lower case with no special characters. You should change dp300storage in the example to a unique name such as **dp300storagemsl123**. Use the name of the resource group starting with **DP-300-HADR** that you made note of above.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Change the **-n** and **-g** parameters as needed.

    ```bash
    az storage account create -n dp300storage -g DP-300-HADR --kind StorageV2 -l eastus2
    ```

1. Next you will get the account keys for your account, which you will use in subsequent steps. Execute the following code in Cloud Shell using the unique name of your storage account and resource group.

    ```bash
    az storage account keys list -g DP-300-HADR -n dp300storage
    ```

    Your account key will be in the results of the above command. Make sure you use the same name (after the **-n**) and resource group (after the **-g**) that you used in the previous command. Copy the returned value for **key1** (without the double quotes) as shown here:

    ![Screenshot of the storage account key on Azure portal.](../images/dp-300-module-15-lab-06.png)

1. Backing up a database in SQL Server to a URL uses container within a storage account. You will create a container specifically for backup storage in this step. To do this, execute the commands below.

    ```bash
    az storage container create --name "backups" --account-name "dp300storage" --account-key "storage_key" --fail-on-exist
    ```

    where **dp300storage** is the storage account name used when creating the storage account and **storage_key** is the key generated above. The output should return **true**.

    ![Test](../images/dp-300-module-15-lab-07.png)

1. To further verify the container backups has been created properly, execute:

    ```bash
    az storage container list --account-name "dp300storage" --account-key "storage_key"
    ```

    where **dp300storage** is the storage account name used you created and storage_key is the key you generated above. The output should return something similar to below:

    ![Screenshot of the container list.](../images/dp-300-module-15-lab-08.png)

1. A shared access signature (SAS) at the container level is required for security. This can be done via Cloud Shell or PowerShell. Execute the following:

    ```bash
    az storage container generate-sas -n "backups" --account-name "dp300storage" --account-key "storage_key" --permissions "rwdl" --expiry "date_in_the_future" -o tsv
    ```

    where **dp300storage** is the storage account name you created above, **storage_key** is the key generated above, and **date_in_the_future** is a time later than now. **date_in_the_future** must be in UTC. An example is **2021-12-31T00:00Z** which translates to expiring at Dec 31, 2020 at midnight.

    The output should return something similar to below. Copy the whole shared access signature and paste it in **Notepad**, because it will be used in the next task:

    ![Screenshot of the shared access signature key.](../images/dp-300-module-15-lab-09.png)

## Back Up AdventureWorks2017

Now that the functionality is configured, you can generate a backup file as a blob in Azure.

1. Start **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.

1. You will be prompted to connect to  SQL Server. Ensure that **Windows Authentication** is selected, and click **Connect**.

1. Click **New Query**.

1. Create the credential that will be used to access storage in the cloud with the following Transact-SQL. Fill in the appropriate values:

    ```sql
    IF NOT EXISTS  
    (SELECT * 
        FROM sys.credentials  
        WHERE name = 'https://dp300storage.blob.core.windows.net/backups')  
    BEGIN
        CREATE CREDENTIAL [https://dp300storage.blob.core.windows.net/backups]
        WITH IDENTITY = 'SHARED ACCESS SIGNATURE',
        SECRET = '<SAS token>'
    END;
    GO  
    ```

    Where both occurrences  of **dp300storage** are the storage account name created above and **sas_token** is the value generated at the end of the previous task.

    The **SECRET** for the `CREATE CREDENTIAL` command should be in this format:

    `'se=2020-12-31T00%3A00Z&sp=rwdl&sv=2018-11-09&sr=csig=rnoGlveGql7ILhziyKYUPBq5ltGc/pzqOCNX5rrLdRQ%3D'`

1. Click **Execute**. This should be successful. If you mistyped and need to recreate the credential, you can drop it with the following command, making sure to change the name of the storage account:

    ```sql
    -- Only run this command if you need to go back and recreate the credential! 
    DROP CREDENTIAL [https://dp300storage.blob.core.windows.net/backups]  
    ```

1. Back up the database AdventureWorks2017 to Azure with the following command in Transact-SQL:

    ```sql
    BACKUP DATABASE AdventureWorks2017   
    TO URL = 'https://dp300storage.blob.core.windows.net/backups/AdventureWorks2017.bak';
    GO 
    ```

    where **dp300storage** is the storage account name used in **Task 1**.

    If something is configured incorrectly, you will see an error message similar to the following:

    ![Screenshot of the backup error.](../images/dp-300-module-15-lab-10.png)

    If an error occurs, check that you did not mistype anything during the credential creation, and that everything was created successfully.

## Validate the backup

To see that the file is actually in Azure, you can use Storage Explorer (preview) or Azure Cloud Shell.

1. Start a browser session and navigate to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/). Connect to the Portal using the Azure **Username** and **Password** provided on the **Resources** tab for this lab virtual machine.

1. Use the Azure Cloud Shell to run this Azure CLI command:

    ```bash
    az storage blob list -c "backups" --account-name "dp300storage" --account-key "storage_key"
    ```

    Where **dp300storage** is the storage account name you created above and **storage_key** is the key used there as well.

1. To use the Storage Explorer (preview), from the home page in the Azure portal select **Storage accounts**.

    ![Screenshot showing selecting a storage account.](../images/dp-300-module-15-lab-11.png)

1. Select the storage account starting with **dp300storage**.

1. In the left navigation, select **Storage Explorer (preview)**. Expand **BLOB CONTAINERS**, then select **backups**.

    ![Screenshot showing the backed up file in the storage account.](../images/dp-300-module-15-lab-12.png)

## Restore from URL

This task will show you how to restore a database from an Azure blob storage.

1. From **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**, select **New Query**, then paste and execute the following query.

    ```sql
    USE AdventureWorks2017;
    GO
    SELECT * FROM Sales.Customers WHERE CustomerID = 1;
    GO
    ```

    ![Screenshot showing the customer name before the update was executed.](../images/dp-300-module-15-lab-13.png)

1. Run this command to change the name of that customer.

    ```sql
    UPDATE Sales.Customers
    SET CustomerName = 'This is a human error'
    WHERE CustomerID = 1;
    GO
    ```

1. Re-run **Step 1** to verify that the name has been changed. Now imagine if someone had changed thousands or millions of rows without a WHERE clause â€“ or the wrong WHERE clause. One of the solutions involves restoring the database from the last available backup.

    ![Screenshot showing the customer name after the update was executed.](../images/dp-300-module-15-lab-14.png)

1. To restore the database to get it back to where it was before the customer name was mistakenly changed, execute the following.

    **Note:** `SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE` syntax the open transactions will all be rolled back. This can prevent the restore failing due to active connections.

    ```sql
    USE [master];
    GO

    ALTER DATABASE AdventureWorks2017 SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE
    GO

    RESTORE DATABASE AdventureWorks2017 
    FROM URL = 'https://dp300storage.blob.core.windows.net/backups/AdventureWorks2017.bak'
    GO

    ALTER DATABASE AdventureWorks2017 SET MULTI_USER
    GO
    ```

    Where **dp300storage** is the storage account name used above.

    The output should be similar to this:

    ![Screenshot showing the restore database from URL being executed.](../images/dp-300-module-15-lab-15.png)

1. Re-run **Step 1** to verify that the customer name has been restored.

It is important to understand the components and the interaction to do a backup to or restore from the Azure Blob Storage service.

You have now seen that you can back up a database to a URL in Azure and, if necessary, restore it.
